MarbleLadder implements a system that facilitates reporting of 1v1 results for 'Marble It Up!', and uses reported results to calculate ELO rankings. Users create an account and can then report their match results against other players. Opponents can confirm the match results, and ELO is distributed accordingly. Global leaderboard tracks all users.
